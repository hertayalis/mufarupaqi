Who's the killer and what are the motives of the murder?"<p>The lead cast list for 7 Women and a Murder includes Margherita Buy as Margherita, Diana Del Bufalo as Susanna, Sabrina Impacciatore as Agostina, Benedetta Porcaroli as Caterina, Micaela Ramazzotti as Veronica, Luisa Ranieri as Maria, and Ornella Vanoni as Rachele.</p><p>Ever since the movie's arrival on Netflix, it has been getting quite the attention of the audience due to its dramatic storytelling and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>unexpected ending</a>, which will be discussed further in this article.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer: This article contains major spoilers for the movie</strong></p><h2>7 Women and a Murder ending: Secrets and deception form the core of the murder-mystery</h2><h3>Was Marcello murdered?</h3><p>The plot for the Italian movie kicks off when the titular seven women find themselves in quite a tricky situation upon discovering that Marcello, the patriarch of their family, has been murdered in his sleep.</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>movie</a>, Margherita is Marcello's wife, Susanna is his eldest daughter, Caterina is his youngest daughter, Agostina is his sister-in-law, Rachele is his mother-in-law, Veronica is his lover, and Maria is the new maid of his house. After Marcello is found dead in his bed with a knife in the back, the household erupts into chaos.</p><p>When the ladies try to contact authorities, they find that their telephone line has been cut and the main gate has been locked, thereby imprisoning them inside the house. The situation takes a turn for the worse when they begin to suspect each other as the one who committed the crime.</p><p>It is later revealed that they all had different motives to kill the man. Owing to their vulnerable state, they soon start spilling their dark secrets, unmasking one another in the process.</p><p>However, at the end of 7 Women and a Murder, the audience learn that Marcello was not murdered. He faked his own death and made his room look like a crime scene, with the help of his youngest daughter Caterina. He did it because he wanted to know who was loyal to him, before he made the final changes in his will.</p><h3>What happened to Marcello in the end?</h3><p>After the truth is disclosed, the women rush to Marcello's room to confront him. When they enter the room, they find no one. Upon going to the balcony, they witness a horrifying scene: Marcello dead on the ground in front of the house.</p><p>During the time everyone was revealing their secrets, Marcello's wife Margherita and his lover Veronica revealed that they were both having an affair with another man, who turned out to be Marcello’s business partner. It was very likely that Marcello overheard their conversations, realized that no one truly loved him, and thus, decided to end his own life by jumping from the balcony.</p><p>At the very end of the movie, when the police arrive, the seven women decide to stick together and cover for each other.</p><p>They realize that they are now free, with no patriarch in the house to control them and decide to stay in the house for the festive season.</p><p>Don't forget to catch 7 Women and a Murder, which is currently streaming on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-is-sponsored=false>Netflix</a>.</p><p>More from Sportskeeda</p>" modalPopup.closeOnEsc = false; modalPopup.setHeader("Why did you not like this content?"); modalPopup.setContentText(modalText); modalPopup.addCancelOkButton("Submit", resetRatingAndFeedbackForm, sendRating); modalPopup.removeCloseModalIcon(); modalPopup.disableDismissPopup(); modalPopup.open(); } else { sendRating(index); } } function sendRating() { var requestPayload = { "post_id": 1345326, "rating_value": ratingValue } if (ratingValue > 3) { requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = null; requestPayload.rating_feedback = null; } else { if (!$('input[name="drone"]:checked') || !$('input[name="drone"]:checked').value) { showErrorMessage('option'); return; } if (!$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea") || !$(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value) { showErrorMessage('note'); return; } var selectedOption = $('input[name="drone"]:checked').value; var feedbackNote = $(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea").value; requestPayload.rating_feedback_type = selectedOption; requestPayload.rating_feedback = feedbackNote; } pureJSAjaxPost(addratingAPI, requestPayload, onsaveRatingSuccess, onsaveRatingFail, function() {}, true); } function resetRatingAndFeedbackForm() { var activeStars = Array.from($all('.rating span.rating-star.active')); for (var i=0; i &lt; activeStars.length; i++) { activeStars[i].classList.remove("active"); } if ($('input[name="drone"]:checked')) { $('input[name="drone"]:checked').checked = false; } var userNote = document.querySelector(".post-rating-feedback-note textarea"); userNote.value = ''; modalPopup.close(); } function onsaveRatingSuccess() { modalPopup.close(); savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie(); $("#post-rating-layout").classList.add("hidden"); $("#post-rating-message").classList.remove("hidden"); window.setInterval(function showMessage() { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.add("hidden"); }, 3000); } function onsaveRatingFail() { console.error('Saving post rating failed!'); modalPopup.close(); } function savePostIdInUserRatedPostsCookie() { userRatedPostIds.push(1345326); var expiryTime = new Date(); expiryTime.setMonth(expiryTime.getMonth() + 12); // Expiry after 1 year setCookie("user_rated_post_ids", JSON.stringify(userRatedPostIds), expiryTime); } function isPostRatedByUser() { var userRatedPostIds = getCookie('user_rated_post_ids'); if (userRatedPostIds) { try { userRatedPostIds = JSON.parse(userRatedPostIds); } catch (err) { console.error(err); return false; } } else { return false; } if(userRatedPostIds.indexOf(1345326) >= 0) { return true; } else { return false; } } function getRatingCountByPostId(postId) { return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { pureJSAjaxGet( getRatingCountBaseURL + postId + '/rating/count', function(data) { try { data = JSON.parse(data); if (data.meta_value) { resolve(data.meta_value); } reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } catch (err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); } }, function(err) { reject("Failed to fetch rating count for the post:" + postId); }, true); }); } function showErrorMessage(messageType) { var messageContainerId = '#' + messageType + '-error'; $(messageContainerId).classList.remove('hidden'); window.setInterval(function () { $(messageContainerId).classList.add("hidden"); }, 5000); } (function() { var callFired = false; function lazyLoadPostRating() { if (callFired) return; callFired = true; if (!isPostRatedByUser()) { getRatingCountByPostId(1345326) .then(function(ratingCount) { if (ratingCount &lt; 10) { $("#post-rating-widget").classList.remove("hidden"); } }) .catch(function(err){ console.error(err); }); } } document.addEventListener("scroll", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("mousemove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); document.addEventListener("touchmove", lazyLoadPostRating, { passive: true, once: true }); })();<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6uso5WasaJ6wqikaKifpXqkwcutrKudX2x6uLvMnqVmpaWnsaa%2BjJ6lnaGenHqmxM%2BlmKKmlZl6qbvWZqSaqpOaua27jJ6lnWWUmq6l</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./florida-gulf-coast-vs-georgia-southern-prediction-odds-picks-for-college-basketball-tuesday-12192023.html><span>←</span><span>Florida Gulf Coast vs. Georgia Southern Prediction, Odds, College Basketball Picks [12/19/2023]</span></a>
