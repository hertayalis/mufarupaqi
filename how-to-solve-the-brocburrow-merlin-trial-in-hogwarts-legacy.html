Unfortunately, if you spend more time looting chests than visiting shops, then you’re going to quickly end up filling all of your gear slots, which means that in order to pick up new gear, you’ll have to destroy an item of old gear, or else interrupt whatever you’re doing in order to go visit a vendor. The good news is that if you just want to hoard more gear, then there is a way. Every time you complete a level of the ‘Complete Merlin Trials’ exploration Challenge, you get more gear slots. One of the more difficult Merlin Trials is in the little village of Brocburrow, which is high in the hills southeast of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><p data-injection=true><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What to do when your gear slots are full in Hogwarts Legacy</a></p><h2>How to complete the Merlin Trial in Brocburrow</h2><p>The Brocburrow Merlin Trial is on a little rocky mound right in the middle of Brocburrow village, so sprinkle a handful of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mallowsweet Leaves</a> onto the Merlin Trial marker, and start looking around for a puzzle to solve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hogwarts_Legacy_Brocburrow_Merlin_Trial_walls.jpg><p>Your objective in the Brocburrow <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Merlin Trial</a> is to move a large stone ball into a circular stone recess in the ground, and the good news is you don’t need to learn any advanced spells to do it. Your Basic Cast and any Force spell (such as Accio) will, quite literally, do the trick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hogwarts_Legacy_Brocburrow_Merlin_Trial_ball.jpg><p>From the Brocburrow Merlin Trial marker, head south and follow the path up the mountainside. You should pass the circular stone recess on the way. Use your Basic Cast spell to destroy all three of the loose stone walls on the path, then use a spell to make the large stone ball roll down the hill. With a bit of luck, and maybe some skill, it’ll roll its way into the circular stone recess. But if it misses, just work some magic to get it into the target. Once it’s in place, the Merlin Trial will complete.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a5e85c730ab96d45a3825718875719a9?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Gavin Mackenzie</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Gavin Mackenzie has been playing video games since the early 80s, and writing about them professionally since the late 90s.
