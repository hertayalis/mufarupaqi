But Not To Kendrick Lamar</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hotnewhiphop.com/imgprst/2292x1200-fit-81-auto/2024/05/Drake-Metro-Boomin-Response-Diss-Beat-Kendrick-Lamar-Diss-Beef-Hip-Hop-News.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> has allegedly responded to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a> making a "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">diss beat</a>" titled "BBL Drizzy" that he challenged fans to rap over for a free beat. We say "allegedly" because it's unclear where DJ Akademiks got this Instagram comment screenshot from, as at press time there's not a post about this on Metro's IG. Regardless, he allegedly wrote "You just cheffed a beat about my a**?" and some folks in the comments section down below have pointed out how he chose to respond to this before addressing the predator accusations or anything else that wasn't his alleged daughter. As such, don't hinge on the veracity of this response, but whether or not it exists doesn't change his silence.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It doesn't change <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a>'s silence either. Drake accused him of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">domestic violence</a> against his partner, and with these serious allegations in mind, folks want accountability to see who's really telling the truth. But at this point, especially after the release of "Not Like Us," it's more about the narrative and the chess game right now. Maybe that's an unfortunate consequence of rap beef, but Kendrick suggested that there is still more in the tank. Depending on Drizzy's response, they might either have to keep going back and forth until they run out of bluffs, diversions, and excuses... or try to end it all in one final blow.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-s-alleged-response-to-bbl-drizzy-beat>Drake's Alleged Response To "BBL Drizzy" Beat</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, tapping out is also an option, although a pretty unlikely one considering how this has all developed so far. As fans debate <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">who's winning right now</a>, neither Kendrick Lamar nor Drake are showing any signs of slowing down, mostly because this has happened so fast that we haven't even had time to see them. The turnaround time on these back and forths has ranged from three weeks to 30 minutes, and we can't forget that if there's actually a nuclear option in either MC's arsenal. But the pressure is definitely on right now, more so than it was just a couple of days ago.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, Metro Boomin deserves all the respect in the world, but it's fair to say that he's not the main event or target right now. If Drake really responded to this before almost anything else, it's really not a good indication of prioritization. As folks dig up <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">more alleged receipts</a> on his questionable behavior, it won't be easy to change the public narrative. But it's the 6ix God against Mr. Morale: they've done more astonishing things than this.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnboR1fpdmm6uZm5p6rrHTq6Zmmp%2Bkuqq6jKucrKifo8CmecOiqqxlkpqutXnKnqWdqpmYuG64wKaYq2WUnsC0ecGenJ9lmJ69brTOqWSnnaeo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dom-brack-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dom Brack - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
