Yeah, I mean, I’ve been talking about Amblin for so long. And now I’m like, actually, I was just in a meeting at Amblin. And I met with a spider wrangler. And he was showing me all different kinds of species of spiders, and I was terrified. So it’s a it’s a huge dream come true. I’m a huge fan of the original. I think it’s a really, really fun film. But I don’t, I’m not trying to apply any kind of pressure to myself. I don’t want to be in competition with another movie, that movie will always stand alone.</p><p>And so for me, the goal was to just… and the reason why I agreed to do it in the first place is not just because, “Ooh, here’s a cool remake”. I actually had a take, I had an idea for it that was different from the original, but still honors, I think, the original and I’m just very, very excited and very eager to make that film. I think we’re gonna make it this year. I don’t want to like jinx it, I’m knocking on whatever I can find. But we’re pretty far along in the process.
