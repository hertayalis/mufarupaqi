She showed up in an all-black fit that had people buzzing online, but they weren't the only ones. In a video making the rounds online of Megan when she first walked up to her seat, she briefly stops to pose for some photos once she gets there. It's in that clip that fans spotted someone who can't help but take in the look she's serving up.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While Megan Thee Stallion throws up a peace sign and poses for a photo, a man sitting behind her got caught staring. Another fan taking a video happened to perfectly catch their extended glance at Megan's look. One fan grabbed a screenshot and replied with a pretty hilarious tweet. "I am him. He is us," the caption of his post reads. It comes attached to a hilarious zoomed in picture of his face. Check out the hilarious tweet and fan reactions to it below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-man-caught-staring-at-megan-thee-stallion>Man Caught Staring At Megan Thee Stallion</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Megan may not have seen the hilarious video of the man staring at her yet. That's because <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she revealed her approach to social media</a> in an interview earlier this week. She revealed that she keeps Instagram off of her phone as an important social media boundary. But she also pointed out that she does love one social media quite a bit, Pinterest.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of the most talked about moments of her night at the Lakers game had nothing to do with her outfit or the man caught staring at her. That came when Lakers star D'Angelo Russel came crashing into the stands after avoiding landing on a photographer <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">and bumped right into Megan</a>. What do you think of the man getting caught staring at Megan Thee Stallion while she poses for pictures? Do you agree with the tweet claiming that the man represents everyone online?
