"Both you and Scott hold a very dear place in my heart as your act was the very first professional stagehand job I had way back in 1998," magician Hat and Hare <a href=#>commented</a> on Jenny Alexander's Instagram. "I learned a tremendous amount from that show that allowed me to be successful with other acts."</p><p>Scott showed off his magical talents in a <a href=#>demo tape</a> posted on his YouTube channel, <a href=#>"The Scott Alexander Show."</a>&nbsp;However, his passion in life was more profound than simply beguiling audiences. He also wanted to spread a message of love and unity. With that purpose in mind, Scott teamed up to tour with fellow magician Puck, an <a href=#>"America's Got Talent"</a> Season 7 finalist.</p><p>Scott told <a href=#>"Good Morning Rochester"</a> that it had been a no-brainer for them to join forces. "We both made it to the finals, and we said, 'You know what? We're both doing good at this whole thing. Why don't we team up and make an act together?'" he said on the show. Scott said they both shared a drive for more than simple magic. "There have been very few magic comedy duos or illusion duos, and none that are a black man and a white man doing an act together," he said. "We can use magic to speak and talk about diversity, racial issues, social issues."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlpZoR0fo6tn55lpKeuqLXCZpuemaSderCyjJqknqqZmK60ecaoq2askaGyr8CMmqOupV2osLDA02aYpZ2olrulsdFo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-berry.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Berry - Distractify</span></a>
