Her move to the Oscars has fans wondering whether Rihanna has been granted the honor of inclusion in the Academy Awards before, and how many Oscars she’s snatched up over the years.</p><h2 id=h-how-many-oscars-does-rihanna-have data-injectable=false>How many Oscars does Rihanna have?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=626 data-current-count=926 data-injectable=true>Rihanna has won a mind-boggling number of awards over the course of her 20 year career. In total, she’s been nominated for a staggering 625 awards, and she’s won a full 230. These include laurels from some of the most celebrated awards shows in circulation, including the Grammys, American Music Awards, Billboard Awards, and BET Awards. She’s collected nine Grammys since 2008’s “Umbrella” dazzled listeners, and nearly the same number of People’s Choice Awards and iHeartRadio music awards, and that’s nothing compared to the 12 Billboard awards and 13 American Music awards.</p><p data-characters=669 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rihanna’s history</a> is littered with so many honors, it may be surprising to learn that this is her first Oscar nomination. The Academy Awards, or Oscars, celebrate wins across the American film industry, and Rihanna isn’t typically primarily connected to cinema. Her work as a musician traditionally falls into other areas, but this year will see that change. Rihanna is up for recognition in the Best Original Song category, against RRR‘s “Naatu Naatu,” Everything, Everywhere, All at Once‘s “This Is a Life,” Top Gun: Maverick‘s “Hold My Hand,” and Tell It Like a Woman‘s “Applause.”</p><p data-characters=322 data-current-count=322 data-injectable=false>Rihanna’s “Life Me Up,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">from 2022’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</a>, is up against some fierce competition, but fans of the 35-year-old star are confident in her chances. She’s already made a brand out of being the GOAT of a range of awards programs, so why should the Oscars be any different?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMppinsV2kwKSt0axkoZmjYr%2BqtMCnpZplp6S7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./edin-dzeko-bio-age-height-wife-parents-children.html><span>←</span><span>Edin Deko Bio, Age, Height, Wife, Parents, Children, Net Worth</span></a>
