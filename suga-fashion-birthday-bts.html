The underground Korean rapper turned Grammy-nominated global idol has a birthday today, so in celebration of the BTS holiday, please indulge me while I brag about this humble genius.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let's start with his talent. His songs are the emotional equivalent of a hot cup of coffee in the middle of a blizzard — though he'd probably prefer a metaphor of an iced Americano on a sweltering summer day. Either way, that's how a Suga song feels when you hear it. His music is a soul-soothing elixir hitting you just when and where you need it most, warming you with lyrics so utterly authentic and honest that each of his over 100 credited songs are each a hallmark in the human experience. Suga is a true artist so deeply devoted to creating beautiful music that he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>even wrote a love song about his piano</a> — be right back, swooning over this tough and tender talented man.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He doesn't hold back — another trait that endears him to his legions of fans — and has spoken honestly about mental health, his hate of societal norms and unrealistic beauty standards, and support of the LGBTQIA+ community. (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"Everyone is equal."</a>)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Suga is also low-key the comedian of BTS. His deadpan delivery never fails to crack up his fellow members, and honestly, will you ever hear a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>better bullfrog impression than Yoongi's</a>? As if all that weren't enough for one man to embody, he's also so beautiful and so stylish it will disrupt your sense of reality. That Daegu DNA blessed the world with a man so gorgeous that some days it's hard to tell if he's real or if he just walked out of a Vermeer painting. And his style! Even in sweatpants and a baseball hat — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>maybe especially in sweatpants and a baseball hat</a> — Suga can cause a global meltdown. With that in mind and in honor of his birthday, here are 6 signature Suga fashion moves that make me weak as a kitten.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-headbands></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Headbands</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>BTS_twt/Twitter, Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We're all simps for headband Suga — sorry, I don't make the rules.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's a look that is equally as gorgeous on both sides of his personality: they become scorchingly hot when Suga wears them while burning the stage and become heart-meltingly cute on domestic Yoongi shopping for groceries. If headband-Suga walked up to me, looked me straight in the eyes, and asked me to walk into a volcano for him, there's a good chance I'm dipping my toes in lava before he can say, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>hajima</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fuzzy-sweaters></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fuzzy Sweaters</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images, BTS_twt/Twitter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ayo, Suga — what are you doing to us?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nothing makes me collapse into a fetal position faster than Suga's commitment to fuzzy sweaters. Every time he shows up somewhere looking as soft as a kitty, my heart just cannot take it. Maybe it's because the cozy aesthetic increases his husband-material-quotient by 100%. Maybe it's seeing this deeply intense, no-nonsense No. 1 Billboard rapper who's secure enough in his masculinity to wear whatever he wants, regardless of his tough guy brand.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-statement-glasses></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Statement Glasses</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>BTS_twt/Twitter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Min Yoongi in glasses just hits differently, doesn't he?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He's not the first idol to embrace fun eyewear (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hello, Park Jimin</a>!), but his selcas with glasses give me whiplash with their duality. Wire-rimmed wearing genius producer, tinted shade donning hypebeast, oversized specs only a model could pull off — the vibes are endless and oh so pretty.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-all-black></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>All Black</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since BTS's 2013 debut, Suga's devotion to all-black everything has been part of his dark (and wild) allure. He is the Korean Johnny Cash — the guitar-strumming man in black. What else could we expect from the idol <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>who cited Batman as one of his style heroes</a>?</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tuxedos--suits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tuxedos & Suits</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images, BTS_twt/Twitter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oh, tuxedoed Suga. I love you more than you love a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>bowl of tangerines</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I am forever-pining over all of Bangtan in their beautiful <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>suits</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>tuxedos</a>, but Suga wears them especially well. There's just something about an underground rapper swapping his baggy streetwear for a dapper red carpet moment (but not losing an ounce of that confident swagger) that does me in. I need at least one tuxedoed Min Yoongi pic a day to keep my youthful glow.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-too-short-d-2-era></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The (Too Short) D-2 Era</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>BTS_twt/Twitter</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Okay, this isn't technically a "style move" but I really do need to give Agust D his due applause. This era wore me out, kids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Late in May 2020, when the full flex of the pandemic was really hitting us, Suga dropped his alter-Bangtan ego's second mixtape, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>D-2</a>. It was a light in the dark. A bright and brilliant album just when everything else in the world was feeling especially bleak. I clung to Agust D's quick-tongued talent and agile dual-language wordplay like a weighted blanket, especially the lead single "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Daechwita</a>." I streamed it for days, listening to it so much that I would wake up with it playing in my brain before I even opened my eyes in the morning.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I also clung to the breathtaking set of new visuals that Agust D gifted to the world. Min Yoongi took on two roles: a sword-wielding, swaggering ice-blonde king and a dangerous rebel with a seriously sexy undercut. Pick your poison, Yoongi stans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Happy birthday, King. Here's hoping your next present comes on the Grammys stage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9KunppllpbAqbXOp2SboaKptaWt2GaZras%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spencer-locke-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Spencer Locke Net Worth</span></a>
