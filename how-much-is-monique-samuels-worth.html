While Monique has since left the reality show, she's definitely not missing out on the Bravo paycheck. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Monique has an estimated net worth of $4 million, which can be attributed both to her time on the show and also to several of her business ventures.</p><p dir=ltr>Another reason why Monique won't be missing her Bravo paycheck is because the reality TV network barely paid the former "Real Housewife" anything during her earliest days on the show. On the "Behind the Velvet Rope" podcast, Monique revealed that she was only paid a few thousand dollars per episode during her first season on the show. "I spent more on my wardrobe and makeup than I made that first season ... that check wasn't anything," she said (via <a href=#>CheatSheet</a>). After accounting for bills and legal fees, Monique estimated that she made $42,000 that year. "So, I walked away with nothing my first season. I don't think I even made money until my third season. It's literally like pennies."&nbsp;But the good thing for Monique is that she's building an empire with essential oils company Mila Eve Essentials and media platform Not For Lazy Moms. While the WAG to former NFL player Chris Samuels is no longer on TV, it does not look like she's missing that meager Bravo payday at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW1lbX16e8eormalpZi1brXSZqSoppmmwqZ50pqkrp2cqHq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-long-can-baby-actors-work-a-day.html><span>←</span><span>How long can baby actors work a day?</span></a>
