She gave birth to her son, Gray Allen, in May and she shares her baby with her fiance, Gus Gazda.</p><p dir=ltr>In a touching moment, Nilsa explained to Page Six how her pregnancy brought her closer to certain cast members. "I know I got closer with Jeremiah [Buoni] and Candace [Rice] because I feel like they really respected my pregnancy. If I needed to go on a walk, Jeremiah would take me on a walk. I mean, look at that body — he obviously walks a lot!"</p><p dir=ltr>While she got tons of support, Nilsa also opened up about the challenges of being pregnant on set, especially where alcohol was concerned. "Everyone knows I'm a big party girl and I couldn't participate, you know, in very much of the drinking activities," Nilsa told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. "A lot of the snow activities, like, that we were doing, I couldn't really do. So that was very different." Whether Nilsa appears on future seasons of "Floribama Shore" with baby Gray in tow is yet to be determined. We know we'd love to see some family moments though!</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know is struggling with addiction issues, help is available.
