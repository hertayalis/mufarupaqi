People are curious about the parents of Jorge Masvidal.</strong></p><p>The Miami, Florida-born and reared Cuban-Peruvian was destined to be a warrior.</p><p>Unquestionably, ‘Gamebred’ has come a long way from his days as an infamous young man to his present status as one of the UFC’s most popular fighters.</p><p>As a teenager, Jorge was quickly drawn into the world of fighting. Jorge also began street fighting before he even finished high school.</p><p>Unfortunately, Masvidal’s poor academic performance resulted in his expulsion from St. Brendan High School. Masvidal therefore began his karate and mixed martial arts training.</p><p>Jorge Masvidal is a professional boxer who ranks among the best in the world. He owes those who have confidence in him for their success.</p><p>With this in mind, let’s take a closer look at Jorge Masvidal’s parents and how they influenced the person he is today.</p><h2><span id=Who_Are_Mama_Dukes_And_Jorge_Masvidal_Sr_The_Parents_Of_Jorge_Masvidal>Who Are Mama Dukes And Jorge Masvidal Sr., The Parents Of Jorge Masvidal?</span></h2><p>Jorge came from a really difficult family. His father, Jorge Masvidal Sr., escaped Cuba and arrived in the Virgin Islands using a homemade raft.</p><p>Masvidal Sr. eventually made it to Miami, where he began a new career as a builder. Masvidal Srpast, however, ultimately caught up with him and was promptly arrested.</p><p>According to sources, Masvidal Sr. was detained on suspicion of manslaughter and drug trafficking. He is currently on supervised release.</p><p>Jorge’s mother, Mama Dukes, worked extremely hard to support both herself and her little son. To provide for herself and her son, Mama Dukes tried her best to sell beads.</p><p>She continued by saying that he only discovered the truth when he was 13 years old and that his father was a member of the military.</p><p>Although the state of Mama Dukes and Masvidal Sr.’s relationship is currently unknown, Jorge claims that both of them are still very significant to him.</p><p>Despite the circumstances, Mama could support her son with the help of her family.</p><p>She deserves kudos for everything her son has accomplished so far. In a way, she is the only one who has managed to keep Jorge Masvidal’s family together.</p><h2><span id=Who_is_Iman_Kawa_Jorge_Masvidal8217s_ex-girlfriend>Who is Iman Kawa, Jorge Masvidal’s ex-girlfriend?</span></h2><p>Iman Kawa and Jorge Masvidal dated for ten years prior, according to the records. Iman Kawa is the sister of Anthony Kawa and well-known MMA agent Malki.</p><p>The relationship between Jorge and Iman was well known, and the fighter even visited her YouTube channel. Two daughters and a son make up the couple’s three children.</p><p>Iman has a fulfilling profession aside from her union with Jorge. In addition to running her YouTube channel, “Better Than Your Mother’s,” she is a prosperous businesswoman and chef.</p><p>Jorge and Iman co-parented three kids, although they reportedly never wed. The pair split up as recently as 2018, and Jorge’s recurrent affairs and issues committing totally to the union were the main factors.</p><h2><span id=Jorge_Masvidal_Net_Worth>Jorge Masvidal Net Worth</span></h2><p>Jorge doesn’t appear to have mentioned his money, suggesting that he might be a little discreet about it.</p><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Jorge’s anticipated net worth in 2022 will be more than $6 million. The athlete must still independently check this information, though.</p><p>Jorge portrays himself as wealthy in his social media posts, enjoying the finer things in life and behaving lavishly.</p><p>He has more than 3 million Instagram followers under the handle @gamebredfighter. He routinely shares photos of his games, workouts, and other activities with his loved ones.</p><p>By frequently updating his profile and publishing articles, the athlete appears to be fairly active there.</p><h3><span id=Also_Read_Taylor_Kitsch_Doesn8217t_Have_Time_To_Date_Or_Wed><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Taylor Kitsch Doesn&#39;t Have Time To Date Or Wed"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":37248,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial","18":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/taylor-kitsch-doesnt-have-time-to-date-or-wed/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/taylor-kitsch-doesnt-have-time-to-date-or-wed/"}{"1":57}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Taylor Kitsch Doesn’t Have Time To Date Or Wed</a></span></span></h3><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>UFC fighters</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Aryna Sabalenka Parents: Father Sergey Sabalenka And Mother Juliya Sabalenka</a></h3>Sergey and Juliya Sabalenka, Aryna's parents, supported her in realizing her goals.
