Davidson also falls into an oddly specific role on the late night variety show that kickstarted his career.

However, when it comes to paying for a friend’s birthday dinner, anything can happen, especially when that friend is Kid Cudi and Kanye West shows up to join in on the celebration.</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=139 data-injectable=false>In a stint on The Tonight Show, Davidson shared his story about dining with the famous rappers and how he got stuck footing the bill.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Over the years, Pete Davidson has been known to shift his style often and without warning. He suffers from borderline personality disorder and his battle is a constant one, but it never seems to slow him down.
