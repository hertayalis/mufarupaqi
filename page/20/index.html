It's two generations ago, i.e. one of your four grandparents, who each gave you 25% of your DNA, on average. Obviously, an ancestor can't be a decimal number of generations away from you.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Tall Is Kim Pegula: Her 2022 Net Worth Explored</h2><time>Aug 15, 2024</time>
