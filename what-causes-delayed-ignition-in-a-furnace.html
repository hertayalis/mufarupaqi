Accordingly, what are some possible causes of delayed ignition?Delayed ignition is usually caused by dirt or a minor fault. In most cases, a technician can solve the problem by performing some basic furnace maintenance or replacing a part. Others causes call for more extensive repair work. In a gas furnace, the air-to-fuel ratio may be off, making the gas hard to ignite.Similarly, how long should it take for a furnace to ignite? Dan mentioned that his furnace takes about 15 minutes, and, simply put, that’s way too long. Your furnace should start up within five minutes of you turning on your thermostat. Period. Similarly, why does my furnace make a loud boom? If your furnace makes a loud BOOM sound as it starts up, you have a problem called “delayed ignition”. Delayed ignition is caused when gas builds up inside your combustion chamber, leading to a small explosion when it finally ignites.Is Delayed ignition dangerous?Too little gas at the burners—Like too much air, not enough gas makes it hard for the gas-air mixture to ignite. There are a ton of other causes (like misaligned or dirty burners), but you get the idea. Why delayed ignitions are costly and dangerous. Several explosions by the delayed ignition can damage the furnace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSesrSu1LOxZ5ufonuotI6wn5qsXZiutr%2FErGSdnZyWxqawjKKep6GknryvecinZJpllqq%2Fr63CnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./triple-berry-pie.html><span>←</span><span>Triple Berry Pie Modern Honey</span></a>
