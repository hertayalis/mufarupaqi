It was reported that 75 pairs were ordered by the Academy so they could be distributed to the Oscar nominees. According to the young fashion designer, her management company knew people within the area and she was informed that someone was “inspired by her story” and asked if she wants to be involved in this year’s gift suite.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=717 data-injectable=true>Out of all the celebrities she’d like to see wearing her shoes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya</a> is the one she’s most excited about.

She was around age 6 when she was first interested in fashion, and after seeing her mother’s interest in shoes, she wanted to emulate that. Later, her mother gave her access to the computer so she could design sneakers.</p><p>“My mom, she was just like ‘do you want to make sneakers?’ and I was like ‘sure.’ And she gave me the computer and she was just like ‘okay, go make sneakers.’ And I was just like ‘huh?’ And she was like ‘go make sneakers and come back with a shoe.’</p><p data-characters=557 data-current-count=874 data-injectable=true>The Oscar gift bag contains a lot of high-valued products that are worth around the six-digit mark. Asides from these shoes,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this year’s gift bag</a>&nbsp;also contains skin-care products, tequila, soaps, and so many other cool items. These gift bags tend to spark debate on social media, especially since it showcases a “wealth divide” between those with extravagant lifestyles and the everyday working class.
