Archaeological evidence appears to confirm this acquired meaning, as boards from about 1300 BCE onward replaced the basic squares of the early senet boards with hieroglyphic birds associated with the Egyptian soul. This symbolism persisted until the game fell out of fashion about 2500 years ago.</p><p>The prevalence of religious symbols on younger boards coupled with the density of references to senet in spiritual writings all suggest this evolution was more than a simple aesthetic re-skin featuring images of the occult. For ancient Egyptians, a game of senet was likely an immediate way to experience the progression of the soul on its path to reaching the afterlife.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9l3FrbWlfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZquhnV2Wu6S1xKerZp2Xrr21tcCnZJunkaexbrPAppxmp5Zisaat06Fm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./novak-djokovic-parents-dijana-and-srdan-dokovic.html><span>←</span><span>Novak Djokovic Parents: Dijana and Sran okovi</span></a>
