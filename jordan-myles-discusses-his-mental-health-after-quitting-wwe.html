The t-shirt triggered things from my past and it all came up at once, and a lot of anger from my past came up with it, as well. That caused me to come at people the way that I did. Again, I’m not gonna apologize for what I said. What I said, I meant it.”</p><p>Jordan Myles might not be wrestling again for WWE from the look of things. All we can hope is that he finds himself in a much better place soon.</p><p>November 17, 2019 7:53 pm</p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e5BqZmpvX5%2B8s7DAp2SmsZyawG6wyKyarqujmsButMisZKadnqmurXnHnpilrJhirqfAxKtkqq2ZqcGqusZmrrCdXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./joe-walsh-net-worth-156501.html><span>←</span><span>Joe Walsh Net Worth</span></a>
