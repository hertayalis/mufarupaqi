This means he was unable to use that arm to aim and shoot a gun during the latest episode.</p><p>Many fans have since shared their wishes that they hope he takes the time to heal the injury properly.</p><p>The injury was not shown on Life Below Zero, but Jessie vaguely referred to his injured arm.

However, the latest episode showed that the scar from the accident has mostly healed.</p><p>The Life Below Zero star said the doctor gave him the go-ahead to start getting some movement in his arm. He was also told to “keep any kind of impact down” for the next five to six weeks (from filming).</p><p>He is now well enough to train for more races, including two teams signed up for Iditarod this year. Jessie plans to re-enter the mid-distance circuit and seems more active on his Instagram.</p><p>However, he did say the injury would change his outlook on his summer. Jessie said: “I feel like I was meant to have this wake-up call and it just puts things into perspective for me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jessie Holmes (@jessie_holmes__)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-jessie-have-a-wife>Does Jessie have a wife?</h2><p>Jessie is not currently married, and hasn’t confirmed being in a relationship.</p><p>However, recent pictures with a woman named Julie suggest she could be his girlfriend.
