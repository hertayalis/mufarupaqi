Fans of the show would remember how Miranda asked Calvin for divorce on their anniversary, as trouble had been brewing between them for ages. While viewes were still divided on who's right or wrong, it came as a surprise to everyone when Calvin announced that he was in love with Laura, and wanted to move on from Miranda. For a long time, Miranda was unable to let this go, and tried to convince him to get back.</p><p>They even shared a kiss, but that was never addressed, either. It was a sure sign that they still had feelings for each other, and were finding it difficult to move on. Instead, later, Calvin says he's madly in love with Laura. Laura told Calvin about how Miranda had warned her that he hadn't been a good husband and he had a wandering eye. Nevertheless, Laura seemed to still want to move on with Calvin, and they shared a kiss. Miranda walked in on them kissing. The storyline was left hanging, and for the past few episodes we've been focussing on the vape pen, that belongs to Jazmine's (China Anne McClain) boyfriend Kaleb, though it was found in her pocket. We haven't seen a trace of Calvin and Miranda since then, so we're still wondering what became of that toxic relationship.</p><p>To be honest, viewers were more invested in their drama, rather than rooting for them to get back together, because they had made each other practically miserable during the course of their relationship. There were cases of infidelity, unecessary yelling and much abuse. Miranda was tired of Calvin not doing anything for himself, and just sitting back and relaxing. Now, Calvin has a thriving job and has made something of himself, after long last. While their drama was annoying, it was currently better than the vape pen tale that's going in the show. Also, another plotline to address — what happened to Malik's (Doc Shaw) pregnant stripper girlfriend? There has been no trace of her, either. Storylines and characters seem to disappear down a wormhole, don't they? There was also a conversation about Jazmine being pressured into sex, but no trace of that either.</p><p>'House Of Payne' airs on BET on Wednesdays at 8 pm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooJ%2BqwKZ5zp9kqZmpo7Juv8SaqqimXW56przIrKadnV1mhG6vwKWtoqZdorazrc2dmGajmajAbrjOr5xmm5%2Bqva2xjJ%2BcnqSZo7S0ecGeq2armKTEbsLInq6eqqNiwbc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-jacksonia-145-jackson-street.html><span>←</span><span>The Jacksonia, 145 Jackson Street - Condo in Williamsburg</span></a>
