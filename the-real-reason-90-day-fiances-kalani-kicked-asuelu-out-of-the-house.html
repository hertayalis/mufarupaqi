Things got nasty when Kalani and Asuelu visited Asuelu's mother, Lesina, in Washington. While there, Lesina asked for a $1,000 loan from the couple. Kalani told her the couldn't spare that much, and the&nbsp;<a href=#>argument escalated</a>&nbsp;from there. At one point,&nbsp;<a href=#>Kalani even got into a physical altercation</a>&nbsp;with Asuelu's sister, per&nbsp;<a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a>. Making matters worse? Asuelu didn't step in to defend his wife, making Kalani question whether the marriage is worth saving.</p><p>Given all of the conflict, some fans were hardly surprised when it got revealed that Asuelu and Kalani were&nbsp;<a href=#>no longer living together</a>. At the hight of the COVID-19 virus, Kalani became even more annoyed with Asuelu for not taking social distancing and other health precautions seriously. Asuelu refused to stop hanging out with his friends and volleyball team, which potentially put the rest of the family in danger, so as a last resort, Kalani bought him a one-way ticket back to his mom's house in Washington.</p><p>When the reunion aired, Kalani informed her castmates that Asuelu was living with her again, but he still wasn't being careful about social distancing or taking preventative actions. "Today, we are together, and we're living together, but we aren't anywhere near where we used to be when we were first together," she explained, according to&nbsp;Showbiz&nbsp;Cheat Sheet. "We're just in a really rocky place right now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma25gaYN1e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl1ufW6wwLJkn6GRo7Cmv4ykmKWZnp56rLXCpJydZZGowqa41GamrqxdpLNuwMeeZKGnpaiycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./post-6220.html><span>←</span><span>tetsuya()(</span></a>
