<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Giuseppe Gamba Biography</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>QUICK FACTS</strong><br>Activity Actor<br>Nationality Mexico<br>Birth December 20, 1984</p><p><strong>BIOGRAPHY</strong><br>Giussepe Gamba is a Mexican actor who graduated from the Artistic Education Center (CEA). When he was a child he never imagined becoming an actor, in fact, he wanted to become a footballer, boxer or musician but he gave an acting career a chance when someone suggested he take a workshop. “My passion for acting began when I really had an approach to this art. It was not until I entered CEA that this passion arose. Acting was like love at first sight,” he confessed to Sensacine México.</p><p>He began his career in theater in productions such as Othello , by William Shakespeare, and Ciudad Paranoia , by Édgar Chías. On television he began in 2011 with the soap opera Amorcito Corazón , a production by Lucero Suárez on Televisa, where he played the role of Mauricio Rossi. He continued with the role of Zeus in My heart is yours , produced by Juan Osorio in 2014.</p><p>Starting in 2016, great opportunities came that catapulted his career in the medium. He participated in the Mexican production of Rosario Tijeras as Sudarsky between 2016 and 2017, and in Atrapada , where he played the villain Alexander Vargas. Regarding Atrapada , Giussepe declared in an interview for Sensacine México that it is a project for which he has a lot of affection and respect, because although it is a series about violence, he does not approach it from a morbid place. In the series he shares credits with Pamela Almanza, with whom he made a great connection, according to his words.</p><p>In cinema he participated in 2016 in Tus pheromones me matan , directed by Juan Carlos de Llaca and in 20119 it was confirmed that he would participate in Instrucciones para Su De él (2020) by José Ramón Chávez. This production had planned its premiere at the Guadalajara Film Festival, but the coronavirus pandemic forced them to change the calendar. About Instructions for Her , where he shares the screen with Paulina Dávila, he explains that “it talks about loss and how human beings are sometimes not prepared to let go.”</p><p>In 2020, Cindy, la Regia (2020) arrived, an adaptation of the comic created by Ricardo Cucamonga. The film was a success at the box office and divided Mexican critics. Giussepe told Sensacine México that he saw the film about 12 times, between screenings , public screenings and going to the cinema with his family. Giussepe is extremely proud of the film: “It gives a message that has to be said. It talks about the search for identity, about following your dreams and where you are going . ”</p><p>The filming was a dream for him and he remembers with humor some of the recordings, especially the making of the scene in which he appears naked. “It is not comfortable at all and it was an absolute failure because the lower protection fell off. Every time they shouted ‘action’ it fell off, so it was more of an obstacle. But it makes people laugh that I tell this,” Giussepe shared .</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGifmarAprzPnmSgmZ2Xrm6uyKieq5mgncZw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-kittiesmama-net-worth-207810.html><span>←</span><span>Emma Kittiesmama Net Worth</span></a>
