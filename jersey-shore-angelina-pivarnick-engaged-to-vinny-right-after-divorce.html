The group was out to lunch to seemingly celebrate Vinny Guadagnino’s birthday. It was only day two of Vinny meeting the Jersey Shore group and a day after Angelina held her divorce party.</p><p>That didn’t bother Vinny, though, as he grabbed Angelina’s hand to profess his love for her while the cast looked on in awe.</p><p>“I want to grow old with you. I want to experience everything with you. I wouldn’t want to experience it with anyone else, together, as one. My best friend, I love you so much, and I just wanted to give you something. I love you, Ang, and I hope that you’ll marry me,” Vinny expressed, pulling out a ring box proving it was the real deal.</p><p>Angelina immediately said yes with her Jersey Shore family by her side, happy yet ready to have a little fun at her expense.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-jersey-shore-family-vacation-cast-reacts-to-angelina-pivarnick-s-engagement>The Jersey Shore: Family Vacation cast reacts to Angelina Pivarnick’s engagement</h2><p>There was a lot of mocking of the quick timing of Angelina and Vinny’s engagement, especially since the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a> cast had just met him.</p><p>“We just met him yesterday! She just burned her wedding dress yesterday! Now she’s gonna have to buy another one,”&nbsp; Pauly “DJ Pauly D” DelVecchio spilled.</p><p>Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino was also in disbelief at what happened. “This is a mind-blowing development in the squad. Like, yesterday was the divorce party. Go straight to a proposal? It’s wild.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>JWoww and Snooki echoed what the guys as shock pretty much summed up how the cast felt.</p><p>Even Angelina Pivarnick was surprised by the proposal, but she’s happier than ever. One night she’s throwing a divorce party. The next, she’s getting in engaged. It was a lot for Angelina to take in.</p><p>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation airs Thursdays at 8/7c on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5qav7Sx2Gaqoaeimnqiusaeo6KmkWK9qsLAq6Wim5tisq%2BzwKCcnWWkpHq3tc2nsGaqmZy1tXnAn6ueql2Ztre70ZycaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jamaican-jerk-chicken-tacos.html><span>←</span><span>Jamaican Jerk Chicken Tacos Modern Honey</span></a>
