It was estimated that he had been dead for at least a couple of days. [May 1995]</p><p>The same critic did not take so kindly to his role as Karl in "Die Hard" (1988) ("a sight gag in his terrorist costume").</p><p>His first movie role was as the Amish farmer Daniel in "Witness" (1985). The NY Times reviewer described him as the film's "most riveting presence".</p><p>He joined the American Ballet Theater and danced with it until 1982 when he and its director Baryshnikov had a falling out. He was by then a frequent companion of <a href=#>Jacqueline Bisset</a>.</p><p>In August 1979 he did defect. The story grew in importance when his ballerina wife returned to the USSR a few days later.</p><p>In 1973 he won a gold medal at the Moscow International Competition. The same year he received more praise when the Bolshoi toured the United States. He was then marked as a potential defector and not allowed to tour for five years.</p><p>He was born on Sakhalin Island at the far eastern end of the former Soviet Union and began studying dance at age 9 in the Riga State Ballet School. He later said his mother put him there to prevent his becoming "a hooligan". One of his classmates and friends at the school was <a href=#>Mikhail Baryshnikov</a>. After graduating he toured with the Moscow Classical Ballet. He joined the Bolshoi in 1971; there he received rave reviews for the lead in "Swan Lake", "Giselle" and other classical and contemporary works.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVflrmmxMCnm56qXZy8pcHNqK0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./richard-dawson-family-feud-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>The Richard Dawson Family Feud Scandal That Was Kept A Secret</span></a>
