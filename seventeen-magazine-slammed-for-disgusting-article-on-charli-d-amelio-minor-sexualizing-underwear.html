Charli D'Amelio wore <a href=#>the outfit</a> for Machine Gun Kelly's launch party. The TikTok star, 17, also shared a photo of herself wearing <a href=#>the ensemble</a> on her <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> too.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Meghan Markle mocked by trolls over ill-fitting red dress at museum gala appearance</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Astroworld: Khloe Kardashian called 'satanic' for posting hot pics after tragedy</a></p><p>"Charli D'Amelio is currently repping my favorite of her many <a href=#>style personas</a>: that of angsty emo gf. She and Lil Huddy attended the official launch party of Machine Gun Kelly's new nail polish brand (potentially the most pop-punk sentence I've ever written in my life) <a href=#>dressed up</a> in their best grunge attire," the article, which has been widely criticized, reads.</p><h2 class=split><strong>What is social media saying?</strong></h2><p>Social media is enraged after the magazine released the article. "Hey @seventeen I understand you need an eye catching headline but charli d‚Äôamelio is literally a minor so can you not do this," one user wrote. "@seventeen should be ashamed of themselves for posting such content about a 17 year old girl. This is disgusting. A disgrace to journalism. Do better, @seventeen. Apologize to Charli D‚ÄôAmelio. Stop sexualizing underage girls with your clickbait content. #SEVENTEEN #charlidamelio," wrote another.</p><p>"I didn‚Äôt click on it but I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre talking about an outfit she posted on Instagram and not her actual underwear but like what audience are you trying to attract with that title?" said one user, while another wrote, "</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I didn‚Äôt click on it but I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre talking about an outfit she posted on Instagram and not her actual underwear but like what audience are you trying to attract with that title?</p>‚Äî Bianca ü•® (@heybiancaj) <a href=#>December 7, 2021</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>On an Instagram post discussing the same issue, one user wrote, "No news/gossip site should be making articles about someone‚Äôs underwear, that‚Äôs just creepy." "Fire the person who wrote this and fire whoever approved it," wrote one user. "The fact that they need to push topics like this in this manner to stay relevant or whatever," one user wrote, while another said, "The article was referring to an outfit she wore, which honestly? Was decently modest. It was more like a two piece body suit if we‚Äôre being real. AND she wore a lace cover and a giant leather jacket. The headline was so unnecessary and creepy."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq5Wrsq%2FAxJ6lZqWRnK67tc2eZKykkaK6prCMn6arZZSewKjB0q2gp59dlr%2B1tcKlnGannmKwqa3RpaBmnF2Wuqa4yKhkpqGepL9uv8SxrJqkma%2B2r7OMrqWdnaKssqK%2B</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rosalia-fluffy-snowball-coat-celine.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Rosala Wears a Fluffy Celine Coat Straight Off The Runway</span></a>
