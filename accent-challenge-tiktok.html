Popular words to kick off the challenge include "aluminum," "tomato," "squirrel."</p><p>Many who have made the accent videos have written the words out as the users speak them.</p><p>The videos have garnered more than 200 million views on the app, and people are really having fun making them. A lot of people who got thousands of views on their videos have made "Part 2" content.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@whatwegandidnext href=#>@whatwegandidnext</a><p>UK V.

For example, in an Australia vs. United States accent video, the American user called summer shoes "flip flops," while the Australian participant referred to them as "thongs."</p><p>The accent challenge doesn't even have to take place between people from multiple countries — regional accents work just as well too (and are sometimes even funnier).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There's a solo version of the Accent Challenge on TikTok too.</h2><p>While the comparison videos between people with vastly different accents are going viral on TikTok, there's also a version that can be done with just one person.
