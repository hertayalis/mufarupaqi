I don’t know why I would go to my favorite bookstore in the dream. It would be closed, and it so freaked me out, and it happened so many times that when I got back into America that first day, one of the first things I did was I took an Uber to go see the favorite bookstore” — how wild is that?</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>He then proceeded to explain that this recurring nightmare about his favorite bookstore back home was “perhaps a testament to the effect that Survivor can have on you.” After all, the beloved competition series has been said to take a toll on not only your physical health, but your mental health as well…</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>He concluded with a chuckle, “I’d been away for a month, and I was questioning the fundamental cores of my reality, my relationships —&nbsp;is my bookstore still around?
