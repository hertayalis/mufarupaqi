His career has been active since 1986.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Brian Cashman is, as of mid- 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Brian Cashman`s net worth is as high as $12 million, acquired through his successful career in baseball; his annual salary amounts to $3 million.</p><h3>Brian Cashman Net Worth $12 Million</h3><p>Brian Cashman is the third child of five born to Nancy and John Cashman. Although born in Rockville Centre, Brian grew up in Washingtonville, but before he even entered high school, he and his whole family moved to Lexington, Kentucky, as his father was hired as the manager of the Castleton Farm. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School, from which he matriculated in 1985. After that he enrolled at the Catholic University of America, and immediately began playing baseball for the university`s team. He graduated in 1989 with a degree in history.</p><p>Brian`s career began while he was still in college, joining the New York Yankees as an intern; Brian`s father, John, met and befriended <a href=#>George Steinbrenner</a>, and soon enough their friendship helped Brian to start his career. When Steinbrenner was banned from baseball in 1990, Gene Michael was hired as team`s GM, with Brian as his assistant, and two years later it was official – Brian became the Assistant General Manager.</p><p>Six years later, Brian succeeded Bob Watson as Senior Vice-President and General Manager, signing a contract worth $300,000 over one year, which certainly increased his net worth by a large margin; he also became the second-youngest GM in the MLB history. Since then, he has served as the Yankees GM, and has been credited with several successful trades and player signings, including <a href=#>David Justice</a>, who won the American League Championship Series (ALCS) Most Valuable Player Award in 2000, CC Sabathia, A. J. Burnett, and <a href=#>Mark Teixeira</a>, whom he then traded for <a href=#>Nick Swisher</a>, and also he traded <a href=#>Alfonso Soriano</a> for <a href=#>Alex Rodriguez</a>. Furthermore, he signed Nathan Eovaldi, <a href=#>Masahiro Tanaka</a>, Brian McCann, Jacob Elisbury, and many others. His successful management of the team has been crowned with five World Series championships and seven American League trophies. All helped add to his net worth.</p><p>Thanks to his skills, Brian has received several awards and recognitions, including the Major League Baseball Executive of the Year in 2009 by the Baseball Writers’ Association of America, and he was also selected for the Crain’s New York Business 40 under 40 list in 1999.<br>Regarding his personal life, Brian was married to Mary from 1995 until 2012 when she filed for divorce. Reasons were left undiscovered, however, according to sources, a women followed Brian and demanded money on accounts of an alleged extramarital affair.</p><p>Brian considers himself an adrenaline junkie; he has performed several stunts throughout his life, including rappelling from a 350-foot building in Stamford, Connecticut, and he also parachuted from a plane with members of the United States Army Parachute Team, and while doing that he broke his right fibula and dislocated his right ankle.</p><p>Brian now resides in Darien, Connecticut.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=15.292929292929><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Brian Cashman</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$12 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 3, 1967</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Rockville Centre, New York, United States</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Profession</td><td>American baseball executive, General Manager of the New York Yankees</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Lexington Catholic High School, Catholic University of America</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Mary Bresnan (m. 1995–2013)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Grace Cashman, Teddy Cashman</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Nancy Cashman, John Cashman</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Karen Young, Susan Coyle</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>布萊恩·凱許曼</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1660009/</a></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Awards</td><td>American League pennants, World Series championships (1998, 2000), MLB Executive of the Year (2009, Baseball Writers' Association of America)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>Crain's New York Business 40 under 40 list (1999), Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame (2010)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>MLB Front Office Manager (video game)</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=2><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Senior Vice-President and General Manager of the New York Yankees (1998-present).
