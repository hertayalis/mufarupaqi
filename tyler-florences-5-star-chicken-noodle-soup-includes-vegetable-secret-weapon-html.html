But he makes his version uniquely his own thanks to one addition. The <a href=#>celebrity chef</a> puts a twist on it with a root vegetable.</p><h2>Tyler Florence’s chicken noodle soup includes a turnip in the stock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Tyler-Florence-at-the-Food-Network-New-York-City-Wine-Food-Festival.jpg><p id=par-2_29>The host of The Great Food Truck Race skips storebought stock when making chicken noodle soup. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Food Network</a>, Florence makes chicken noodle soup using nine-ingredient chicken stock.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_41>He puts all the ingredients — fresh herbs, carrots, celery, onions, garlic, and chicken — in a large pot and lets it simmer on the stove. This is all typical of any chicken noodle soup but Florence tosses in something unexpected.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_45>What sets his chicken noodle soup apart from others is the addition of a root vegetable. Yes, a root vegetable. Specifically a turnip. The cookbook author puts a turnip in his chicken stock because, as he once explained on Food 911, it’s his “secret weapon.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_19>“My little secret weapon when I’m making chicken stock is a turnip,” he said. “I really love that smell.”</p><p id=par-6_16>Then he continues making the stock, leaving it to simmer until the chicken is fully cooked.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to make Florence’s chicken noodle soup&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_51>Now that the chicken stock is made it’s time to move forward with the next step in Florence’s chicken noodle soup recipe. He softens onions, garlic, celery, and carrots in a pan with fresh thyme and a bay leaf. Then he adds chicken stock and brings the liquid to a boil.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_42>Next is the noodles. Once they’re tender Florence tosses in shredded chicken from the stock. He lets the meat simmer for a few minutes before seasoning it to taste with salt and pepper. Lastly, he tops the soup with parsley before serving.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_19>Florence’s chicken noodle soup, including the stock, should take just over two hours to make per his recipe instructions.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-food-network-star-s-recipe-has-nearly-500-reviews>The Food Network star’s recipe has nearly 500 reviews</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Tyler-Florence-does-a-cooking-demonstration-at-the-2014Food-Network-New-York-City-Wine-Food-Festival.jpg><p id=par-10_45>At the time of writing, Florence’s chicken noodle soup has been reviewed a whopping 494 times on Food Network’s website. That alone doesn’t earn it a spot as one of his <a href=#>most popular recipes on Food Network</a> but it certainly has the approval of fans.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_14>Florence’s recipe averages five stars and reviewers appreciate how easy it is to prepare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_36>The recipe is “easy and I love it has only a few steps,” one person wrote before adding the “broth has a deep and comforting flavor.” Others called Florence’s recipe their “go-to” for homemade chicken soup.</p><p id=par-13_19>“This was surprisingly easy to make,” a reviewer said. “It was absolutely amazing the broth was rich and delicious!”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_47>Another said Florence’s recipe made the previously frightening task of homemade chicken soup doable. “The idea of making homemade chicken noodle soup was always intimidating to me. After making this recipe and learning just how easy it is, I’ll be making this much more often,” they said.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_25>Additional remarks on the soup included comments such as “best chicken noodle soup I have ever eaten,” “so easy and delicious,” and “wholesome, nourishing, divine.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBurjEq2SfpJ%2Bnsq%2BvxKxkbmWjqa6zecKhoJyjlaN6r7vOnaOeZaOkwrF5yKeapa2UmsBuwsSgnK2ZkqGybr%2FEnKmerF2ssqK8zqdloaydoXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tim-polasek-earnings-as-ndsu-head-coach-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tim Polasek: Earnings as NDSU Head Coach and Net Worth</span></a>
