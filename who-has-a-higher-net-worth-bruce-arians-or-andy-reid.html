Reid got his start in 1992 as an assistant coach to the Green Bay Packers, per <a href=#>Pro Football History</a>.&nbsp;He was named head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles in 1999 and stayed with the team until he transferred to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2013. Bruce Arians joined the NFL in 1989 with, interestingly enough, the Kansas City Chiefs, per his official&nbsp;<a href=#>Buccaneers bio</a>. He began his head coaching journey with the Arizona Cardinals in 2013, per <a href=#>ESPN</a>. After a solid four years with the Cardinals, Arians retired from the NFL following his third cancer scare, per <a href=#>The Tampa Bay Times</a>. He returned in 2019 as the head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers once his health improved.</p><p dir=ltr>It's clear that both coaches head talented teams and also have quite the resume themselves, so it's no surprise that both Arians and Reid make millions each year. According to <a href=#>Sports Illustrated</a>, Reid makes about $10 million annually (<a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports his annual salary as $7.5 million). Meanwhile, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> approximates that Arians makes approximately $5 million a year. With that being said, Reid has a higher net worth at about $25 million and Arians is said to be estimated at $10 million, per Celebrity Net Worth.&nbsp;Reid may have won the battle in the bank, but they have one more chance to face off in Super Bowl LV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGpkZ4B3e9ahpmagkah6onnHop6hnaJiu6bAjLCmq6yYYq%2BzwcKeZJqqmZa7tHnOq2SappSuerOxyJ1m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./you-can-now-watch-death-note-naruto-sailor-moon-and-more-for-free-on-youtube.html><span>←</span><span>You can now watch Death Note, Naruto, Sailor Moon, and more for free on YouTube</span></a>
