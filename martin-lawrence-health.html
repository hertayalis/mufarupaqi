Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Martin Lawrence and the cast of 'Martin' at the 2024 Emmys</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why are fans concerned about Martin Lawrence's health?</h2><p>In January 2024, the Emmy Awards were filled with reunions from classic TV shows. Among those reunions was one from Martin, which was Martin Lawrence's sitcom from the 1990s. The show's ensemble cast assembled to riff about the fact that they never won an Emmy, and Martin then presented the award for best actor in a comedy.</p><p>Following Martin's appearance on the show, though, many were concerned about the comedians overall well-being.</p><p>Some viewers believed that Martin had slurred his speech at times and had taken several long pauses as well, which made it seem like he was having trouble reading from the teleprompter.</p><p>"Can't be the only one concerned about Martin Lawrence," one person wrote online following his appearance on the telecast. Another person wrote: "Did Martin Lawrence have a stroke?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Man, what a night at the Emmy‚Äôs! Feelin‚Äô blessed and honored to have presented alongside my fam! üôèüèæ <a href=#>@TheEmmys</a> <a href=#>#blessed</a> <a href=#>#history</a> <a href=#>#martin</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Q3Y54lXMPM</a></p>‚Äî Martin Lawrence (@realmartymar) <a href=#>January 16, 2024</a></figure><p>Most fans expressed their concern in positive terms, saying that they hoped everything was OK with him. Others were simply grateful to see most of the cast back together again after more than 20 years off the air. "This is the reunion we needed!!! We were overjoyed to see y‚Äôall onstage!!" one person wrote on Twitter.</p><p>Then, in May 2024, after Martin celebrated alongside co-star Will Smith at the Los Angeles premiere of their film Bad Boys: Ride or Die, a clip from the event went viral in which Martin appears to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">holding onto Will</a> as they walk on a bus. This, coupled with the fact that Martin seems to be less energetic than his co-star, caused further concern among fans.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>Martin then decided to address the rumors head-on during an interview with Hot 97's Ebro in the Morning on June 4, 2024, telling listeners, "I'm fine." He went on to say, "I'm in God's hands. I'm blessed. I'm glad to be waking up every day. I'm all good. No need for people to be concerned."</p><p>He later added: "I'm healthy as hell. Stop the rumors."</p><p>Martin has had several <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">health incidents</a> in the past, but those occurred largely in the 1990s and were typically connected to prolonged exposure to the heat or dehydration.</p><p>In recent decades, no news has broken to suggest that Martin is in any way unwell.</p><p>Many fans have also noted online that, considering Martin is now 69, he's not exactly a spring chicken anymore. "I think we need to accept that our heroes are aging and THAT'S OK! We‚Äôll all get there one day," one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commenter wrote on YouTube</a>.</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube commenter</a> wrote, "I can appreciate [Ebro in the Morning] for asking Martin straight up about his health. I'm not sure if I believe him but gotta accept what he said."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zwMinZKWZp6eyr6%2FEZp%2BemZyptQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./linda-lovelace-net-worth-76217.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Linda Lovelace Net Worth</span></a>
