My days are full of activities – paddle tennis, the beach, lunch, drinks, socializing… in fact, they’re full to the brim, but with things I really enjoy.” &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cf33f734d43e-eva-longoria-doorway-photo.jpg><p id=eHqNXNAx3C data-wc=56>"The first time I came to Marbella, two decades ago, it was love at first sight. I said to myself: ‘Some day I’ll live here'. Later, we set up the Global Gift Foundation, and this is where [actor] Antonio Banderas, my best friend [actress and philanthropist] María Bravo and I held the first gala," Eva continued.&nbsp;</p><p id=ep3-mcVK6D data-wc=78>“Five years ago, I said to Nico, who’s very clued-up about property: ‘When you see the right place, let me know.’ I viewed a few places, but nothing was quite what I wanted. Finally, in early 2023, this house came on the market. It needed refurbishing, but it had just the size and location I was after. So, taking advantage of the fact that I was in Barcelona filming, I came down and bought it that same day.”</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Margot Robbie, Eva Longoria and Emma Stone lead the best dressed at Palm Springs International Film Festival Awards" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c7ca803adfa1-palm-springs-gallery.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Margot Robbie, Eva Longoria and Emma Stone lead the best dressed at Palm Springs International Film Festival Awards" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Margot Robbie, Eva Longoria and Emma Stone lead the best dressed at Palm Springs International Film Festival Awards</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/da62abd27834-eva-longoria-son-santiago-posing.jpg><p id=eLnRh3hXzS data-wc=24>The mom-of-one also shared what was most important to her when she was house-hunting: A garden and swimming pool for her son, Santi, five.&nbsp;</p><p id=ef9TCfcz_f data-wc=75>"I wanted a garden for my son to play in, and a swimming pool because he’s always swimming. And, of course, a big kitchen. In all my homes, I have a kitchen with a huge island, where everyone can sit together and have a glass of wine and nibbles while I cook. I love the kitchen – it’s always the heart of the house.
