So I guess I’ll just say thank you. Thank you for being my friend, thank you for making a difference, thank you for being understanding even when we didn’t deserve it, and thank you for being the one and only <a href=# rel=noopener>Shawn Soares</a>. I’m gonna miss you buddy.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=:r2dv:><span class=ez-toc-section id=Delegate_Suhas_Subramanyam_Wrote></span><strong>Delegate Suhas Subramanyam</strong>&nbsp;Wrote,<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>I am devastated by the loss of my friend Shawn Soares. He helped guide me through my first Session as my Legislative Aide and proved to be smart, hard-working, and passionate about serving. But what I’ll remember most about him is our friendship in the years after and our long conversations about politics and life. Shawn’s kindness, generosity, and willingness to help others touched so many people. He had a bright future ahead of him, but in his short time with us he made our futures brighter with all that he did professionally and personally. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. He will be sorely missed.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-114 data-inserter-version=2></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqkZ%2ButLDEp6uapJOkua2xxp5lnKedZLWww4ydoJ1lo52uuLqMrKaaqpWoeqW1xGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sampletalent.html><span>←</span><span>Hire Kevin Kaarl for a Corporate Event or Performance Booking.</span></a>
