In <a href=#>a YouTube video</a>, she divulged that the book will "share stories from my life," those that "nobody saw while the TV cameras were rolling."</p><p>The "19 Kids and Counting" star also clarified that despite fans and critics expecting her to expose the Duggars in her book, it's first and foremost, "not a tell-all about my family." She explained that, instead, the memoir details how she's "disentangling" her Christian faith, as opposed to completely veering away from it. She hopes that by writing this, those who are also "struggling" with their faith can feel encouraged to "examine [their] beliefs without abandoning God."</p><p>While Jinger didn't drop the truth bombs the public had hoped she would, a friend she grew up with thinks the book might still potentially impair her relationship with her parents. Speaking with <a href=#>The U.S. Sun</a>, former Duggar family friend Mary Murphy, who was also shunned from their church, revealed that Jim Bob and Michelle may "shut Jinger out and cut her off" if the book contains questionable claims. But if it doesn't "hurt the family image or the facade of perfection," all will be well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhpZYZzfo6joKeflad6pcHGoJirZaaqvK27jJymp56Zp7q0eceeqWamlax6o7vOpGSarp%2BesbR506GcZqeemnq1u8%2Bimmabop7Bqq%2FSZpirnV2eu7Wx0Z6qrZ2UYravew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-marilyn-manson-a-christian.html><span>←</span><span>Is Marilyn Manson a Christian?</span></a>
