The song captures the essence of real phonk, a genre that has been overshadowed by other styles in recent years. DRAGONMANE’s desire to bring back the genuine sound of phonk is evident in this track, and it resonates with fans who appreciate the roots of the genre.</p><p>The lyrics of COWBELL GOTH paint a vivid picture of the artist’s lifestyle and experiences. It starts off with a catchy chorus that repeats the phrase “Hard 2 tha core” multiple times, emphasizing the intensity and rawness of the music. As the verses unfold, DRAGONMANE takes us on a ride through the streets of North Memphis, where he and his crew navigate the challenges of their environment.</p><p>In the first verse, DRAGONMANE describes cruising down the highway with his friend Skinny, smoking weed and enjoying a sunny day. The mention of “onion” and “scunion” alludes to the type of marijuana they are smoking. The artist also mentions having an AK in his trunk and planning to retaliate against someone who has crossed him. This illustrates the harsh reality of North Memphis and the need to protect oneself in that environment.</p><p>The chorus serves as a powerful anthem, reinforcing the song’s core message. The repetition of “Hard 2 tha core” reflects the resilience and toughness required to survive in a neighborhood where gangsters rule.</p><p>In the second verse, DRAGONMANE mentions Michael Street, a street name that holds significance in the Memphis rap scene. He portrays himself as a fearless individual, ready to take on any challenge. The image of him leaning out of the sunroof of his Bonneville, blasting music from his system, demonstrates both his confidence and his willingness to engage in violent acts if necessary.</p><p>As someone who grew up in a rough neighborhood, I can relate to the themes present in COWBELL GOTH. The song brings back memories of cruising through the streets with friends, feeling a mix of anxiety and exhilaration. It reminds me of the sense of camaraderie that exists within these environments, where surviving and thriving require a tough exterior.</p><p>Despite the gritty nature of COWBELL GOTH, its underlying message is one of authenticity. DRAGONMANE aims to reclaim the real sound of phonk, pushing back against the increasing influence of EDM elements in the genre. The artist’s commitment to phonk’s history is evident in his music, as he pays homage to the genre’s roots through his lyrics and production choices.</p><p>In conclusion, COWBELL GOTH by DRAGONMANE is a powerful representation of the real phonk movement. The song’s lyrics and music combine to create an immersive experience, taking listeners on a journey through the streets of North Memphis. Through his music, DRAGONMANE encapsulates the essence of phonk and reminds us of its importance in the rap industry. COWBELL GOTH is a testament to the artist’s dedication to preserving the true spirit of the genre.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jrBqaKyYmnquscCnoKefXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwLC6xmaaqK%2BSmrmtecaoq6Flkq56pb7AoKanpZGjsm6t0a2grKxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jorge-masvidal-parents-mama-dukes-and-jorge-masvidal-sr.html><span>←</span><span>Jorge Masvidal | Parents, Mama Dukes And Jorge Masvidal Sr.</span></a>
