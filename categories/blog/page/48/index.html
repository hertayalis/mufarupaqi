We included it because it is one of the most popular mainstream coolers, combining good performance with broad compatibility and a very reasonable retail price. Although we do have one more aftermarket cooler in this review, it comes from a CPU manufacturer and is essentially based on the designs of their stock coolers, so the EVO 212 is the only cooler that greatly stands out from the rest.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Why was Hesperia High School teacher John Ryan arrested?

[Verse 1]
(Alright I'm done, ah)
I love what I can’t see
What’s expected of you, what's expected of me?
Now it’s quarter to three
Let it all get away[Refrain]
Oh, what the hell can I do?
To fill the pages (to fill the pages)
Meet the strangers (meet the strangers)
Kiss the girl, take it in, feel the ages (kiss the girl, take it in, feel the ages)
