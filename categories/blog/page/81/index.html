Verse 1
I used to live like I was under attack
Dodging arrows from my past
I had no hope for tomorrow
Felt so much pressure yes
I thought I would crack
But now there’s no looking back
I’m moving forward ‘cuz I know
Pre Chorus
I got my armor now
No fear no doubt can shoot me down
I got my armor now
No fear no doubt gonna shoot me down</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How do I repair my silver sword in Witcher 3?</h2><time>May 31, 2024</time>

Ever since Razer entered the Ultrabook market, they have offered a solid laptop in the ultra-portable category.

The one thing that was tough to not notice though was that it had pretty large display bezels, when much of the competition is now doing their best to make those as small as possible, allowing more display in the same size laptop.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Patriot's Wildfire - OCZ Vertex 3 MAX IOPS &amp;amp; Patriot Wildfire SSDs Reviewed</h2><time>May 31, 2024</time>

Patriot's Wildfire OCZ isn't the only company experimenting with SF-2281 drives and 32nm NAND. Patriot sent me the Wildfire, its first SF-2281 SSD. After a quick run through some performance tests I grew suspicious as it performed a lot like the Vertex 3 MAX IOPS I just tested. Cracking open the case I found the reason:
The Wildfire also uses 32nm Toshiba NAND. The 120GB drive Patriot sent has a 16 chip, 2 die per package configuration - compared to 8 chips with 4 die per package in the Vertex 3 MI.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Shark Tank: meet the partners of Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran and more</h2><time>May 31, 2024</time>
