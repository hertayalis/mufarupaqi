Speaking of the song, Will Smith's daughter gushed, “I am so grateful for this tune because it was created in such an introspective time (during the first couple months of quarantine),” and added, “It was the song that proved to me that I needed to let go of the insecurities I had about making a project of this genre.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Oscars 2021 Full Winners List: Chloe Zhao's 'Nomadland' nabs Best Picture; Anthony Hopkins, Frances McDormand win acting honors</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Lotte Duty Free Family Concert 2021 Full Performers List: BTS, Twice, Super Junior to TXT, here's the line-up of K-pop event</a></p><h2 class=split>What is Willow Smith's net worth?</h2><p>Willow Smith, daughter of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and sister of Jaden Smith has been in the limelight of media ever since her birth. But the young and talented 'Whip My Head' crooner chose to utilize it as a platform for her art as she debuted her acting career with 'I Am Legend' alongside her father at the age of seven. She released her first single 'Whip My Hair' at the age of 10. The single went on to peak at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and got the nod for Video of the Year at the BET Awards of 2011. The young singer's net worth stands at $6M, as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth.&nbsp;</a>In September 2020, Willow paid a whopping $3.1M for a 3,000 square-foot home in Malibu.</p><p>Willow has since released a number of hit singles including '21st Century Girl', which also found its place in Billboard Hot 100. Along with her singing stint, Willow co-hosted the Facebook Watch talk show 'Red Table Talk' and received two NAACP Image Awards and a Daytime Emmy Award nomination.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/52e12be0-ad50-44dd-b6f6-27fffdd1e5ef.1228836917><h2 class=split>'Transparent Soul' with Travis Barker&nbsp;</h2><p>The banger 'Transparent Soul' with Barker is a pop-punk extremely energetic track which is getting all the buzz for the right reasons. This will mark the singer's venture into a full-length album and Willow is confident in delivering the gusto of energy that she envisioned as the main element of this album. The 'Ardipithecus' crooner said, “I thought this was a really dope outlet for a new energy I wanted to bring to my music.” The album is most likely to be released this summer in 2021.
