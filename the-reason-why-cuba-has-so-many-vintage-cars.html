However, the fuse finally blew when Cuban&nbsp;sugar planter Carlos Manuel de Cespedes instigated a revolution by writing a new constitution that&nbsp;emancipated the enslaved, rebelled against Spanish rule, and called for the United States to annex the country in what would be known as the Ten Years' War.</p><p>By 1878, the war had ended in a failure for the revolutionaries. Hope would arrive in 1895, when the Spanish-American War led to an American victory, which resulted in the annexation of Cuba, according to <a href=#>Nations Online</a>. The country then faced a series of coups and authoritarian regimes, often backed by the U.S., for the next half of the 20th century. During this time, due to a lack of their own car manufacturing industry, the Cuban government often imported American cars, according to <a href=#>Lonely Planet</a>. But a new revolution was about to change these friendly relations, as the Cuban people began to have enough of not being able to govern themselves independently.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCEmG5ncmtfqbWmedGemKynnmLEqcWMnKybmV2drrR50qhkppmernq3tc2tmKCdXZius7%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sofia-vergara-opens-up-harrowing-on-set-experience.html><span>←</span><span>Sofia Vergara opens up about harrowing on-set experience that left her thinking she was 'going to di</span></a>
